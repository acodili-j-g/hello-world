# Hello, World! in Java

## Prerequisite

To run java code, you must have Java 8 or newer installed. If you aren't that picky, you may install it from here: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/. After installation, you may run `java --version` on the command line (e.g. Command Prompt or Powershell for Windows) to validate; running the command should print the version of java on the command line.
